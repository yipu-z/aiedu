ACLS often involves a system that can automatically assess student dialogue, model effective and ineffective collaboration, and provide relevant support. While there is evidence that ACLS can improve student learning, little is known about why systems that incorporate ACLS are effective. Does relevant support improve student interactions by providing just-in-time feedback, or do students who believe they are receiving relevant support feel more accountable for the collaboration, and thus more motivated to improve their interactions? In this paper, we describe an adaptive system we have developed to support help-giving during peer tutoring in high school algebra: the Adaptive Peer Tutoring Assistant (APTA). To validate our approach, we conducted a controlled study that demonstrated that our system provided students with more relevant support and was more effective at improving student learning than parallel nonadaptive conditions. Our contributions involve generalizable techniques for implementing ACLS that can function adaptively and effectively, and the finding that adaptive support does indeed improve student learning because of the relevance of the support."}}, {"name": "s40593-013-0002-8.json", "data": {"article-title": "Understanding Attention to Adaptive Hints in Educational Games: An Eye-Tracking Study", "author": [{"author-name": "Cristina Conati", "affiliation": "University of British Columbia", "address": "grid.17091.3e, 0000000122889830, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"}, {"author-name": "Natasha Jaques", "affiliation": "University of British Columbia", "address": "grid.17091.3e, 0000000122889830, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"}, {"author-name": "Mary Muir", "affiliation": "University of British Columbia", "address": "grid.17091.3e, 0000000122889830, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"}], "journal-title": "International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education", "journal-volume": "volume23", "pageStart": "136", "pageEnd": "161", "publication-year": "2013", "keywords": ["Educational games", "Adaptive hints", "Eye-tracking", "Attention to hints"], "citation": "Conati, C., Jaques, N. & Muir, M.

Previous studies have shown that solving problems in a blocked order, in which all problems of one type are completed before the student is switched to the next problem type, results in less effective performance than does solving the problems in an interleaved order. However, we have no precise understanding of the reason for this effect. In addition to existing theoretical results, we use a machine-learning agent that learns cognitive skills from examples and problem solving experience, SimStudent, to provide a computational model of the problem order question. We conduct a controlled simulation study in three different math and science domains (i.e., fraction addition, equation solving and stoichiometry), where SimStudent is tutored by automatic tutors given problems that have been used to teach human students. We compare two problem orders: the blocked problem order, and the interleaved problem order. The results show that the interleaved problem order yields as effective or more effective learning in all three domains, because the interleaved problem order provides more or better opportunities for error detection and correction to the learning agent. Examination of the agent\u2019s performance shows that learning when to apply a skill benefits more from interleaved problem orders, and suggests that learning how to apply a skill benefits more from blocked problem orders."}}, {"name": "s40593-013-0006-4.json", "data": {"article-title": "Towards Automatically Detecting Whether Student Learning is Shallow", "author": [{"author-name": "Sujith M.

In this paper a novel mechanism for studying the quality of the elements in the domain model of CBM systems is presented. This mechanism combines CBM with the Item Response Theory (IRT), a data-driven technique for automatic assessment. The goal is to improve the quality of the elements that are used in problem solving environments for assessment or instruction. In this paper we propose a set of statistical techniques, i.e., the analysis of the point-biserial correlation, the Cronbach\u2019s alpha and the information function, to explore the quality of constraints. Two different tools have been used to test this approach: a problem solving environment designed to assess students in project investment analysis; and an independent component that performs assessments using CBM and IRT. Results suggest that the three methods produce consistent diagnosis and may be complementary in some cases.

In particular, we model the Q&A dialog roles that participants play, emotional features covered by LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count), cohesiveness of the dialogue, the coherence captured by Coh-Metrix, and temporal patterns of participation. We use a discussion corpus from eight semesters of a computer science course, covering conversations of 173 student groups (370 students). We first remove various noises in student discussion data and normalize the discussion data. We then apply machine learning techniques and text analysis tools for classifying dialogue features efficiently. The extracted dialogue and participation features are used as predictive variables for project grades. The correlation and regression analyses indicate that the number of answers provided to others, the number of positive emotion expressions, and how early students communicate their problems before the deadline correlate with project grades.

When multiple representations are presented across consecutive problems, we have to decide in what sequence to present them. Prior research has demonstrated that interleaving tasks types (as opposed to blocking them) can foster learning. Do the same advantages apply to interleaving representations? We addressed this question using a variety of research methods. First, we conducted a classroom experiment with an intelligent tutoring system for fractions. We compared four practice schedules of multiple graphical representations: blocked, fully interleaved, moderately interleaved, and increasingly interleaved. Based on data from 230 4th and 5th-grade students, we found that interleaved practice leads to better learning outcomes than blocked practice on a number of measures. Second, we conducted a think-aloud study to gain insights into the learning mechanisms underlying the advantage of interleaved practice. Results show that students make connections between representations only when explicitly prompted to do so (and not spontaneously). This finding suggests that reactivation, rather than abstraction, is the main mechanism to account for the advantage of interleaved practice. Third, we used methods derived from Bayesian knowledge tracing to analyze tutor log data from the classroom experiment. Modeling latent measures of students\u2019 learning rates, we find higher learning rates for interleaved practice than for blocked practice. This finding extends prior research on practice schedules, which shows that interleaved practice (compared to blocked practice) impairs students\u2019 problem-solving performance during the practice phase when using raw performance measures such as error rates. Our findings have implications for the design of multi-representational learning materials and for research on adaptive practice schedules in intelligent tutoring systems."}}, {"name": "s40593-013-0012-6.json", "data": {"article-title": "Towards an Agile Approach to Adapting Dynamic Collaboration Support to Student Needs", "author": [{"author-name": "David Adamson", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University", "address": "grid.147455.6, 0000000120970344, Language Technologies Institute, School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"}, {"author-name": "Gregory Dyke", "affiliation": "CNRS/PRES Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, ENS", "address": "grid.25697.3f, 0000 0001 2172 4233, CNRS/PRES Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, ENS, Lyon, France"}, {"author-name": "Hyeju Jang", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University", "address": "grid.147455.6, 0000000120970344, Language Technologies Institute, School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"}, {"author-name": "Carolyn Penstein Ros\u00e9", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University", "address": "grid.147455.6, 0000000120970344, Language Technologies Institute and Human-Computer Interaction Institute, School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"}], "journal-title": "International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education", "journal-volume": "volume24", "pageStart": "92", "pageEnd": "124", "publication-year": "2014", "keywords": ["Dynamic support for collaborative learning", "Automatic collaborative learning process analysis"], "citation": "Adamson, D., Dyke, G., Jang, H. et al.

In contrast to past work on dynamic support for collaborative learning, where agents were used to elevate conceptual depth by leading students through directed lines of reasoning (Kumar & Ros\u00e9, IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies, 4(1), 2011), this APT-based approach uses generic prompts that encourage students to articulate and elaborate their own lines of reasoning, and to challenge and extend the reasoning of their teammates. This paper integrates findings from a series of studies across content domains (biology, chemistry, engineering design), grade levels (high school, undergraduate), and facilitation strategies. APT based strategies are contrasted with simply offering positive feedback when the students themselves employ APT facilitation moves in their interactions with one another, an intervention we term Positive Feedback for APT engagement. The pattern of results demonstrates that APT based support for collaborative learning can significantly increase learning, but that the effect of specific APT facilitation strategies is context specific. It appears the effectiveness of each strategy depends upon factors such as the difficulty of the material (in terms of being new conceptual material versus review) and the skill level of the learner (urban public high school vs. selective private university). In contrast, Feedback for APT engagement does not positively impact learning. In addition to an analysis based on learning gains, an automated conversation analysis technique is presented that effectively predicts which strategies are successfully operating in specific contexts. Implications for design of more agile forms of dynamic support for collaborative learning are discussed."}}, {"name": "s40593-013-0013-5.json", "data": {"article-title": "Special Issue on Intelligent Support for Learning in Groups", "author": [{"author-name": "Rohit Kumar", "affiliation": "Raytheon BBN Technologies, Speech, Language and Multimedia Department", "address": "grid.417480.e, 0000000095398787, Raytheon BBN Technologies, Speech, Language and Multimedia Department, Cambridge, MA, USA"}, {"author-name": "Jihie Kim", "affiliation": "University of Southern California", "address": "grid.42505.36, 0000000121566853, Information Sciences Institute, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"}], "journal-title": "International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education", "journal-volume": "volume24", "pageStart": "1", "pageEnd": "7", "publication-year": "2014", "keywords": [], "citation": "Kumar, R., Kim, J.

The PHP Intelligent Tutoring System (PHP ITS) has been designed with the aim of making it easier for novices to learn the PHP language in order to develop dynamic web pages. Programming requires practice. This makes it necessary to include practical exercises in any ITS that supports students learning to program. The PHP ITS works by providing exercises for students to solve and then providing feedback based on their solutions. The major challenge here is to be able to identify many semantically equivalent solutions to a single exercise. The PHP ITS achieves this by using theories of Artificial Intelligence (AI) including first-order predicate logic and classical and hierarchical planning to model the subject matter taught by the system. This paper highlights the approach taken by the PHP ITS to analyse students\u2019 programs that include a number of program constructs that are used by beginners of web development.

We operationalize the probability that an error is careless through the use of an automated detector, developed using educational data mining, which infers the probability that an error involves carelessness rather than not knowing the relevant skill. This detector is then applied to log data produced by high-school students in the Philippines using a Cognitive Tutor for scatterplots. We study the relationship between carelessness and affect, triangulating between the detector of carelessness and field observations of affect. Surprisingly, we find that carelessness is common among students who frequently experience engaged concentration. This finding implies that a highly engaged student may paradoxically become overconfident or impulsive, leading to more careless errors. In contrast, students displaying confusion or boredom make fewer careless errors. Further analysis over time suggests that confused and bored students have lower learning overall.

We describe a system that addresses this challenge by teaching conceptual knowledge about basic electronics and electricity through guided experimentation with a circuit simulator and reflective dialogue to encourage effective self-explanation. The Basic Electricity and Electronics Tutorial Learning Environment (BEETLE II) advances the state of the art in dynamic adaptive feedback generation and natural language processing (NLP) by extending symbolic NLP techniques to support unrestricted student natural language input in the context of a dynamically changing simulation environment in a moderately complex domain. This allows contextually-appropriate feedback to be generated \u201con the fly\u201d without requiring curriculum designers to anticipate possible student answers and manually author multiple feedback messages. We present the results of a system evaluation. Our curriculum is highly effective, achieving effect sizes of 1.72 when comparing pre- to post-test learning gains from our system to those of a no-training control group.

The learning environment consists of 48 2-player game variants based on a graphical model of arithmetic where the mathematical content is intrinsically interwoven with the game idea. The environment also features teachable agents, which are computer programs that can be taught and behave according to their knowledge. Thus, the environment provides both learning-by-doing (playing the game) and learning-by-teaching (teaching the agent to play). It differs from other learning-by-teaching systems 1) by targeting basic mathematics and primary grade students; 2) by using teachable agents as an extension to educational games in order to leverage engagement, reflection and learning; and 3) by using an agent-driven question dialogue to challenge students\u2019 mathematical thinking, to role-model learner behaviour and to transfer game knowledge to out-of-game mathematics. The teachable agent game is described and evaluated in an authentic classroom study enrolling 443 students from 22 classes in 9 schools. Students range from 2nd to 6th grade of mainstream classes and 7th to 8th grade for students with difficulties in mathematics. Part of the study was designed as a quasi-experimental study with controls; part was designed to examine students\u2019 change in mental models of arithmetic before and after game play. All students took pre- and post mathematics tests. The 314 playing students used the game and taught their agents during regular math-classes for three months, whereas the control classes attended standard instruction and took the tests. A questionnaire was distributed at the end of the study to investigate students\u2019 perceptions and performances of the agent-tutoring task. Results show that 1) there is a significant learning gain for playing students compared to controls, 2) the learning environment can engage children in advanced mathematical thinking in early education, 3) young primary students can act as successful tutors. Thus, we conclude that teachable agents in educational games can help achieve deeper levels of learning that transfer outside the game. This idea combines the motivational power of games with the reflective power of a teachable agent asking though-provoking, deep questions on the learning material during game play."}}, {"name": "s40593-014-0019-7.json", "data": {"article-title": "Reasoning Mind Genie 2: An Intelligent Tutoring System as a Vehicle for International Transfer of Instructional Methods in Mathematics", "author": [{"author-name": "George A.

Integrated into an existing suite of software tools called Cognitive Tutor Authoring Tools (CTAT), SimStudent helps authors to create an expert model for a cognitive tutor by tutoring SimStudent on how to solve problems. There are two different ways to author an expert model with SimStudent. In the context of Authoring by Tutoring, the author interactively tutors SimStudent by posing problems to SimStudent, providing feedback on the steps performed by SimStudent, and also demonstrating steps as a response to SimStudent\u2019s hint requests when SimStudent cannot perform steps correctly. In the context of Authoring by Demonstration, the author demonstrates solution steps, and SimStudent attempts to induce underlying domain principles by generalizing those worked-out examples. We conducted evaluation studies to investigate which authoring strategy better facilitates authoring and found two key results. First, the expert model generated with Authoring by Tutoring is better and has higher accuracy while maintaining the same level of completeness than the one generated with Authoring by Demonstration. The reason for this better accuracy is that the expert model generated by tutoring benefits from negative feedback provided for SimStudent\u2019s incorrect production applications. Second, authoring by Tutoring requires less time than Authoring by Demonstration.

For that purpose, we have extended our virtual Bio-safety Laboratory application used for training biohazard procedures with a Narrative Manager. The Narrative Manager controls the simulation deciding which events will take place in the simulation, and when, by controlling the narrative balance of the session. Our hypothesis is that the Narrative Manager allows us to increase the number of tasks for the user to solve and, due to balancing difficulty and intensity, it keeps the user interested in training. When evaluating our system we observed that the Narrative Manager effectively introduces more tasks for the user to solve, and despite that, is accepted by the users as more interesting and not harder than an identical system without a Narrative Manager. Also, a knowledge test demonstrated better results in users\u2019 interest and learning output in the narrative condition."}}, {"name": "s40593-014-0023-y.json", "data": {"article-title": "A Multimedia Adaptive Tutoring System for Mathematics that Addresses Cognition, Metacognition and Affect", "author": [{"author-name": "Ivon Arroyo", "affiliation": "Worcester Polytechnic Institute", "address": "grid.268323.e, 0000000119570327, Learning Sciences and Technologies, Department of Social Sciences and Policy Studies, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, USA"}, {"author-name": "Beverly Park Woolf", "affiliation": "University of Massachusetts", "address": "grid.266683.f, 0000000121849220, School of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"}, {"author-name": "Winslow Burelson", "affiliation": "New York University", "address": "grid.137628.9, 0000000121698901, New York University College of Nursing, New York University, New York, NY, USA"}, {"author-name": "Kasia Muldner", "affiliation": "Carleton University", "address": "grid.34428.39, 000000041936893X, Institute of Cognitive Science, Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada"}, {"author-name": "Dovan Rai", "affiliation": "Worcester Polytechnic Institute", "address": "grid.268323.e, 0000000119570327, Department of Computer Science, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, USA"}, {"author-name": "Minghui Tai", "affiliation": "University of Massachusetts", "address": "grid.266683.f, 0000000121849220, School of Education, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"}], "journal-title": "International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education", "journal-volume": "volume24", "pageStart": "387", "pageEnd": "426", "publication-year": "2014", "keywords": ["Intelligent tutoring", "Cognition", "Metacognition", "Affect", "Mathematics education"], "citation": "Arroyo, I., Woolf, B.P., Burelson, W. et al.

We define progress in three areas: improved student cognition, engagement, and affect, and we attribute this improvement to specific components and interventions that are inherently affective, cognitive, and metacognitive in nature. For instance, improved student cognitive outcomes have been measured with pre-post tests and state standardized tests, and achieved due to personalization of content and math fluency training. Improved student engagement was achieved by supporting students\u2019 metacognition and motivation via affective learning companions and progress reports, measured via records of student gaming of the system. Student affect within the tutor was measured through sensors and student self-reports, and supported through affective learning companions and progress reports.

Development professionals help train teachers and get teachers to participate in studies. The platform and these teachers help researchers (sometimes explicitly and sometimes implicitly) simply by using content the teacher selects. The platform, hosted by Worcester Polytechnic Institute, allows teachers to write individual ASSISTments (composed of questions with answers and associated hints, solutions, web-based videos, etc.) or to use pre-built ASSISTments, bundle them together in a problem set, and assign these to students. The system gives immediate feedback to students while they are working and provides student-level data to teachers on any assignment. The word \u201cASSISTments\u201d blends tutoring \u201cassistance\u201d with \u201cassessment\u201d reporting to teachers and students. While originally focused on mathematics, the platform now has content from many other subjects (e.g., science, English, Statistics, etc.). Due to the large library of mathematics content, however, it is mostly used by math teachers. Over 50,000 students used ASSISTments last school year (2013\u20134) and this number has been doubling each year for the last 8\u00a0years. The platform allows any user, mostly researchers, to create randomized controlled trials in the content, which has helped us use the tool in over 18 published and an equal number of unpublished studies. The data collected by the system has also been used in a few dozen peer-reviewed data mining publications. This paper will not seek to review these publications, but instead we will share why ASSISTments has been successful and what lessons were learned along the way. The first lesson learned was to build a platform for learning sciences, not a product that focused on a math topic. That is, ASSISTments is a tool, not a curriculum. A second lesson learned is expressed by the mantra \u201cPut the teacher in charge, not the computer.\u201d This second lesson is about building a flexible system that allows teachers to use the tool in concert with the classroom routine. Once teachers are using the tool they are more likely to want to participate in research studies. These lessons were born from the design decisions about what the platform supports and does not support. In conclusion, goals for the future will be presented."}}, {"name": "s40593-014-0025-9.json", "data": {"article-title": "Preface-Emerging Technologies and Landmark Systems for Learning Mathematics and Science: Dedicated to the Memory of Erica Melis-Part 2", "author": [{"author-name": "Sergey Sosnovsky", "affiliation": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)"], "address": ["grid.147455.6, 0000000120970344, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA", "grid.17272.31, 000000040621750X, German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI), Saarbr\u7709cken, Germany"]}, {"author-name": "Bruce M.

This paper presents findings from a systematic literature review that focused on barriers to ITS adoption in the developing world. While ITS were the primary focus of the review, the implications likely apply to a broader range of educational technology as well. The geographical and economic landscape of tutoring publications is mapped out, to determine where tutoring systems research occurs. Next, the paper discusses challenges and promising solutions for barriers to ITS within both formal and informal settings. These barriers include student basic computing skills, hardware sharing, mobile-dominant computing, data costs, electrical reliability, internet infrastructure, language, and culture. Differences and similarities between externally-developed and locally-developed tutoring system research for the developing world are then considered.

Research on early versions of AutoTutor documented the impact on deep learning by co-constructed explanations, feedback, conversational scaffolding, and subject matter content. Systems that evolved from AutoTutor added additional components that have been evaluated with respect to learning and motivation. The latter findings include the effectiveness of deep reasoning questions for tutoring multiple domains, of adapting to the affect of low-knowledge learners, of content over surface features such as voices and persona of animated agents, and of alternative tutoring strategies such as collaborative lecturing and vicarious tutoring demonstrations.

In this paper, we show how Astus, as an MTT framework, strive to attain a higher level of automation when generating pedagogical interventions compared to other MTT frameworks such as TDK and CTAT\u2019s MTTs. This is achieved by designing a knowledge representation approach in which each type of knowledge unit has a clearly defined semantic on which the MTT\u2019s pedagogical module can rely on. We explain how this knowledge representation approach is implemented as a knowledge-based system in ASTUS and show how it allows the development of MTTs that can automatically generate the pedagogical content required to provide next-step hints and negative feedback on errors.

This component based (e.g., Singley & Anderson, 1989) approach has been employed in psychometrics (Tatsuoka, 1983), cognitive science (Koedinger & MacLaren, 2002), and most recently in educational data mining (Cen, Koedinger, & Junker, 2006). A typical assumption of these theory based models is that an itemization of \u201cknowledge components\u201d shared between tasks is sufficient to predict transfer between these tasks. In this paper we step back from these more cognitive theory based models of transfer and suggest a psychometric measurement model that removes most cognitive assumptions, thus allowing us to understand the data without the bias of a theory of transfer or domain knowledge. The goal of this work is to help provide a methodology that allows researchers to analyse complex data without the theoretical assumptions clearly part of other methods. Our experimentally controlled examples illustrate the non-intuitive nature of some transfer situations which motivates the necessity of the unbiased analysis that our model provides. We explain how to use this Contextual Performance Factors Analysis (CPFA) model to measure learning progress of related skills at a fine granularity. This CPFA analysis then allows us to answer questions regarding the best order of practice for related skills and the appropriate amount of repetition depending on whether students are succeeding or failing with each individual practice problem.

In order to understand how students perform on collaborative problem solving (CPS) computer-based assessment, it is necessary to examine empirically the multi-faceted performance that may be distributed across collaboration methods. Theaim of this study was to explore possible differences in student performance in humanto-agent (H-A), compared to human-to-human (H-H) CPS assessment tasks. One hundred seventy nine 14\u00a0years-old students from the United States, Singapore and Israel participated in the study. Students in both H-H and H-A modes were able to collaborate and communicate by using identical methods and resources. However, while in the H-A mode, students collaborated with a simulated computer-driven partner, and in the H-H mode students collaborated with another student to solve a problem. Overall, the findings showed that CPS with a computer agent involved significantly higher levels of shared understanding, progress monitoring, and feedback. However, no significant difference was found in a student\u2019s ability to solve the problem or in student motivation with a computer agent or a human partner. One major implication of CPS score difference in collaboration measures between the two modes is that in H-A mode one can program a wider range of interaction possibilities than would be available with a human partner. Thus, H-A approach offers more opportunities for students to demonstrate their CPS skills.

This is followed by a summary of the main elements of the model, then a presentation of its subsequent developments. These comprise the analysis of argumentation dialogue and its potential for collaborative learning, the analysis of interpersonal relations in relation to the interactive regulation of affect, and extensions of the model to other epistemic situations such as explanation generation, co-design, online epistemic discussions and use of communication interfaces in computer-supported collaborative learning environments. On these bases, the object of study of this research is defined as the processes of negotiation of meaning in epistemic situations. It is concluded that the main core of the model was retained, throughout its deepening and extension, but the underlying theory was radically changed, from cognitivist belief-systems to a view of dialogue itself as collective thinking. Two challenges for artificial intelligence and education research are raised: the formalisation of interpersonal relations as they are played out in social interaction, and the analysis of the processes of appropriation of discourse genres."}}, {"name": "s40593-015-0052-1.json", "data": {"article-title": "Implementation of Motivational Tactics in Tutoring Systems: 20\u00a0years on", "author": [{"author-name": "Benedict du Boulay", "affiliation": "University of Sussex", "address": "grid.12082.39, 0000000419367590, Human-Centred Technology Research Group, Department of Informatics, University of Sussex, Brighton, BN1 9QJ, UK"}, {"author-name": "Teresa del Soldato", "affiliation": "Bodywise Natural Health", "address": "Bodywise Natural Health, 21 Old Ford Rd, London, E2 9PL, UK"}], "journal-title": "International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education", "journal-volume": "volume26", "pageStart": "170", "pageEnd": "182", "publication-year": "2016", "keywords": ["Learning", "Teaching", "Motivation", "Pedagogy"], "citation": "du Boulay, B., del Soldato, T.

The support must be flexible enough to accommodate wide individual differences in representational knowledge. In 1995 we saw AIED systems as potentially having several roles; one key role was to enable the learner to move easily from one external representation (ER) to a different one (switching ERs). Other necessary roles included: to seek to use AI to keep several forms of ER in synchrony as the student works on one of them; to guide the student to one ER form (out of several) most likely to be of use; and to help the student use an ER effectively. We outline where our work seems to have had influence and we review progress in the field since 1995.

Secondly, we investigate which emotional support messages the conversational agent should use (for example: using praise, emotional reflection, reassurance or advice) given learner personality and performance. We investigate the adaptation of this feedback to a learner personality, in particular the traits in the Five Factor Model. Five experiments were run where participants gave progress feedback and emotional support to students with different personalities and test scores. The type of emotional support given varied between different personalities (e.g. neurotic individuals with poor grades received more emotional reflection). Two algorithms were created using different methods to describe the adaptations and evaluated on how well they described the experimental data using DICE scores.

Students provided affect judgments at approximately 100 points (every 15\u00a0s) over the course of viewing videos of their faces and computer screens recorded during the learning session. The results indicated that engagement, confusion, frustration, boredom, and curiosity were the most frequent affective states, while anxiety, happiness, anger, surprise, disgust, sadness, and fear were rare. Confusion + frustration and curiosity + engagement were identified as two frequently co-occurring pairs of affective states. An analysis of affect dynamics indicated that there were reciprocal transitions between engagement and confusion, confusion and frustration, and one way transitions between frustration and boredom and boredom and engagement. Considering interaction events in tandem with affect revealed that constructing code was the central activity that preceded and followed each affective state. Further, confusion and frustration followed errors and preceded hint usage, while curiosity and engagement followed reading or coding. An analysis of affect-learning relationships after partialling out control variables (e.g., scholastic aptitude, hint usage) indicated that boredom (r\u2009=\u2009\u2212.149) and frustration (r\u2009=\u2009\u2212.218) were negative correlated with learning while transitions between confusion \u2192 frustration (r\u2009=\u2009.103), frustration \u2192 confusion (r\u2009=\u2009.105), and boredom \u2192 engagement (r\u2009=\u2009.282) were positively correlated with learning.

Central to its development was the notion that it should monitor the student\u2019s collaborative behavior and attempt to guide him/her towards more productive behavior. In prior work, we found that initiative shifts correlate with both Knowledge Co-Construction (KCC) and learning and are potentially easier to model as an indicator of productive collaboration in instructional software. In this paper, we describe a unique peer dialogue agent that we created to test the effects of tracking and reacting to initiative shifts. While our study did not find differences in learning gains when comparing agents that do and do not track and react to initiative shifts, we did find that students do learn when interacting with the agent and that attempting to influence initiative taking did make a difference. This suggests that by tracking initiative shifts, the agent was able to detect times when the student had been letting the agent do most of the \u201cdeep thinking\u201d and that the agent\u2019s tactics for encouraging the student to begin taking the initiative again were helpful."}}, {"name": "s40593-015-0074-8.json", "data": {"article-title": "Commentary on: \u201cToward Computer-Based Support of MetaCognitive Skills: a Computational Framework to Coach Self Explanation\u201d", "author": [{"author-name": "Cristina Conati", "affiliation": "University of British Columbia", "address": "grid.17091.3e, 0000000122889830, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, V6T 1Z4, Canada"}], "journal-title": "International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education", "journal-volume": "volume26", "pageStart": "183", "pageEnd": "192", "publication-year": "2016", "keywords": ["Intelligent tutoring for meta-cognition", "Student modeling", "Self-explanation"], "citation": "Conati, C.

Then, in the bulk of the paper, I propose some principled foundations for future authoring tool design, focusing on operationalizing the construct of complexity\u2014for tool, task, and user. ITS authoring tools are major undertakings and to redeem this investment it is important to anticipate actual user needs and capacities. I propose that one way to do this is to match the complexity of tool design to the complexity of authoring tasks and the complexity capacity of users and user communities. Doing so entails estimating the complexity of the mental models that a user is expected to build in order to use a tool as intended. The goal is not so much to support the design of more powerful authoring tools as it is to design tools that meet the needs of realistic user audiences. This paper presents some exploratory ideas on how to operationalize the concept of complexity for tool, task, and user. The paper draws from the following theories and frameworks to weave this narrative: Complexity Science, Activity Theory, Epistemic Forms and Games, and adult cognitive developmental theory (Hierarchical Complexity Theory). This exploration of usability and complexity is applicable to the design of any type of complex authoring application, though the application area that motivated the exploration is ITS authoring."}}, {"name": "s40593-015-0077-5.json", "data": {"article-title": "Using Ontological Engineering to Overcome AI-ED Problems: Contribution, Impact and Perspectives", "author": [{"author-name": "Riichiro Mizoguchi", "affiliation": "Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology", "address": "grid.444515.5, \t0000000417622236, Research Center for Service Science, Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Ishikawa, Japan"}, {"author-name": "Jacqueline Bourdeau", "affiliation": "TELUQ, Centre de recherche LICEF", "address": "TELUQ, Centre de recherche LICEF, Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada"}], "journal-title": "International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education", "journal-volume": "volume26", "pageStart": "91", "pageEnd": "106", "publication-year": "2016", "keywords": ["Ontological engineering", "Ontology-aware systems", "Ontology of learning/instructional theories", "Theory-compliant learning scenarios"], "citation": "Mizoguchi, R., Bourdeau, J.

This study was one of the first large-scale classroom evaluations of the integrated use of an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) in high schools. A core challenge was figuring out how to embed this new technology into a curriculum and into the existing social context of schools. A key element of the study design was to include multiple kinds of assessments, including standardized test items and items measuring complex problem solving and use of representations. The results were powerful: \u201cOn average the 470 students in experimental classes outperformed students in comparison classes by 15\u00a0% on standardized tests and 100\u00a0% on tests targeting the [course] objectives.\u201d We suggested that the study was evidence \u201cthat laboratory tutoring systems can be scaled up and made to work, both technically and pedagogically, in real and unforgiving settings like urban high schools.\u201d Since this study, many more classroom studies comparing instruction that includes an ITS against business as usual have been conducted, often showing advantages for the ITS-enhanced curricula. More rigorous randomized field trials are now more commonplace, but the approach of using multiple assessments in large-scale randomized field trials has not caught on. Cognitive task analysis will remain fundamental to the success of ITSs. A key remaining question for ITS is to find out how they can be used most effectively to support open-ended problem solving, either online or offline.

In particular, tutorial dialogue systems that engage students in natural language dialogue can create rich, adaptive interactions. A promising approach to increasing the effectiveness of these systems is to adapt not only to problem-solving performance, but also to a student\u2019s characteristics. Self-efficacy refers to a student\u2019s view of her ability to complete learning objectives and to achieve goals; this characteristic may be particularly influential during tutorial dialogue for computer science education. This article examines a corpus of effective human tutoring for computer science to discover the extent to which considering self-efficacy as measured within a pre-survey, coupled with dialogue and task events during tutoring, improves models that predict the student\u2019s self-reported frustration and learning gains after tutoring. The analysis reveals that students with high and low self-efficacy benefit differently from tutorial dialogue. Student control, social dialogue, and tutor moves to increase efficiency, may be particularly helpful for high self-efficacy students, while for low self-efficacy students, guided experimentation may foster greater learning while at the same time potentially increasing frustration. It is hoped that this line of research will enable tutoring systems for computer science to tailor their tutorial interactions more effectively."}}, {"name": "s40593-015-0093-5.json", "data": {"article-title": "Learning Science by Constructing Models: Can Dragoon Increase Learning without Increasing the Time Required?", "author": [{"author-name": "Kurt VanLehn", "affiliation": "Arizona State University", "address": "grid.215654.1, 0000000121512636, Computing, Informatics and Decision Science Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"}, {"author-name": "Greg Chung", "affiliation": "University of California at Los Angeles", "address": "grid.19006.3e, 0000000096326718, Center for Research on Evaluation, Standards and Student Testing, University of California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"}, {"author-name": "Sachin Grover", "affiliation": "Arizona State University", "address": "grid.215654.1, 0000000121512636, Computing, Informatics and Decision Science Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"}, {"author-name": "Ayesha Madni", "affiliation": "University of California at Los Angeles", "address": "grid.19006.3e, 0000000096326718, Center for Research on Evaluation, Standards and Student Testing, University of California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"}, {"author-name": "Jon Wetzel", "affiliation": "Arizona State University", "address": "grid.215654.1, 0000000121512636, Computing, Informatics and Decision Science Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"}], "journal-title": "International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education", "journal-volume": "volume26", "pageStart": "1033", "pageEnd": "1068", "publication-year": "2016", "keywords": ["Intelligent tutoring system", "Model construction", "High school science instruction"], "citation": "VanLehn, K., Chung, G., Grover, S. et al.

Attempts to demonstrate the advantages of model construction have been stymied by the long time required for students to acquire skill in model construction. In order to make model construction a feasible vehicle for science instruction, the Dragoon system combined three simplifications: (1) a simple notation for models of dynamic systems, (2) a step-based tutoring system, and (3) problems that described the model to be constructed as well as the system represented by the model. In order to test whether these simplifications reduced the time for learning how to construct models while preserving the benefits of model construction over baseline instruction, three classroom studies were conducted. All studies were experiments, in that they compared classes using Dragoon to classes learning the same material without Dragoon. However, as classroom studies, they could not tightly control all sources of variation. The first study produced null results, but it compared learning across just one class period. The second study in 4 high school science classes showed that instruction based on Dragoon cost only one extra class period (about 50\u00a0min) out of 4 class periods and was more effective than the same content taught without Dragoon. A third study in 3 more high school science classes, where 2 Dragoon classes and 1 non-Dragoon class met for the same number of class periods, showed that Dragoon was more effective than the same content taught without Dragoon. The effect sizes were moderately large on both an open response test (d\u2009=\u20091.00) and a concept mapping task (d\u2009=\u20090.49). Thus, it appears that our efforts have simplified model construction to the point that it can be used in science instruction with no additional class time needed, and yet it still seems to be more effective than the same instruction done without model construction."}}, {"name": "s40593-016-0094-z.json", "data": {"article-title": "The Future of Adaptive Learning: Does the Crowd Hold the Key?", "author": [{"author-name": "Neil T.

This paper addresses this evolution by identifying six trends. The trends are ongoing and will influence learning technologies going forward. First, the physicality of interactions and the physical space of the learner became genuine components of digital education. The frontier between the digital and the physical has faded out. Similarly, the opposition between individual and social views on cognition has been subsumed by integrated learning scenarios, which means that AIED pays more attention today to social interactions than it did at its outset. Another trend is the processing of learners\u2019 behavioural particles, which do not carry very many semantics when considered individually, but are predictive of knowledge states when large data sets are processed with machine learning methods. The development of probabilistic models and the integration of crowdsourcing methods has produced another trend: the design of learning environments has become less deterministic than before. The notion of learning environment evolved from a rather closed box to an open ecosystem in which multiple components are distributed over multiple platforms and where multiple stakeholders interact. Among these stakeholders, it is important to notice that teachers play a more important role than before: they interact not only at the design phase (authoring) but also in the runtime phase (orchestration). These trends are not specific to AIED; they depict the evolution of learning technologies as a whole."}}, {"name": "s40593-016-0107-y.json", "data": {"article-title": "Technology Support for Discussion Based Learning: From Computer Supported Collaborative Learning to the Future of Massive Open Online Courses", "author": [{"author-name": "Carolyn Penstein Ros\u00e9", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University", "address": "grid.147455.6, 0000000120970344, Language Technologies Institute and Human-Computer Interaction Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, USA"}, {"author-name": "Oliver Ferschke", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University", "address": "grid.147455.6, 0000000120970344, Language Technologies Institute and Human-Computer Interaction Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, USA"}], "journal-title": "International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education", "journal-volume": "volume26", "pageStart": "660", "pageEnd": "678", "publication-year": "2016", "keywords": ["Conversational agents", "Computer-supported collaborative learning", "Massive open online courses"], "citation": "Ros\u00e9, C.P., Ferschke, O.

Therefore, GBeL systems should engage the players in order to support them to maximize their learning outcomes, and provide the players with adequate feedback to maintain their motivation. Innovative engagement monitoring solutions based on players\u2019 behaviour are needed to enable engagement monitoring in a non-disturbing way, without interrupting the game-play and game flow. Furthermore, generic metrics and automatic mechanisms for their engagement monitoring and modelling are needed. One important metric that was used for engagement modelling is TimeOnTask, which represents the duration of time required by the player to complete a task. This paper proposes ToTCompute (TimeOnTask Threshold Computation), a novel mechanism that automatically computes - in a task-dependent manner - TimeOnTask threshold values after which student engagement decreases with a given percentage from his initial level of engagement (e.g., after 2\u00a0min student engagement will fall with 10\u00a0% from his initial level). In this way the mechanism enables engagement modelling at a higher granularity and further enables engagement-based adaptation in GBeL systems. ToTCompute makes use of game-playing information and EEG signals collected through an initial testing session. The results of an experimental case study have shown that ToTCompute can be used to automatically compute threshold values for the TimeOnTask generic engagement metric, which explains up to 76.2\u00a0% of the variance in engagement change. Furthermore, the results confirmed the usefulness of the mechanism as the TimeOnTask threshold value is highly task-dependent, and setting its value manually for multiple game tasks would be a laborious process."}}, {"name": "s40593-016-0112-1.json", "data": {"article-title": "Evolution of an Intelligent Deductive Logic Tutor Using Data-Driven Elements", "author": [{"author-name": "Behrooz Mostafavi", "affiliation": "North Carolina State University", "address": "grid.40803.3f, 0000000121736074, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"}, {"author-name": "Tiffany Barnes", "affiliation": "North Carolina State University", "address": "grid.40803.3f, 0000000121736074, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"}], "journal-title": "International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education", "journal-volume": "volume27", "pageStart": "5", "pageEnd": "36", "publication-year": "2017", "keywords": ["Deductive logic instruction", "Intelligent tutoring systems", "Data-driven methods"], "citation": "Mostafavi, B., Barnes, T.

Recommender Systems are more advanced in this aspect than Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) and Intelligent Learning Environments (ILEs). A reason for this is that the user models of Intelligent Tutoring Systems and Intelligent Learning Environments, i.e. their student models, tend to be more heterogeneous and complex than traditional models used in Recommender Systems. To share and reuse student models we must first understand the restrictions for porting or reusing student models in new ITSs or ILEs. This paper proposes a classification of student models in terms of their portability. Portability is measured via each model\u2019s accessibility, complexity, architecture, popularity, and description. We use this classification to analyse and then grade student models that have been published in the AIED, EDM and ITS research communities in 2013 and 2014. The classification is intended to be used by researchers both as a methodology to measure the portability of a student model and as a guide to find existing reusable models."}}, {"name": "s40593-016-0114-z.json", "data": {"article-title": "Preface to Special Issue on User Modelling to Support Personalization in Enhanced Educational Settings", "author": [{"author-name": "Olga C.

Learning is achieved through a wide range of learning activities. Algorithm visualizations demonstrate the operational functionality of algorithms according to the principles of active learning. So, a visualization process can stop and request from a student to specify the next step or explain the way that a decision was made by the algorithm. Similarly, interactive exercises assist students in learning to apply algorithms in a step-by-step interactive way. Students can apply an algorithm to an example case, specifying the algorithm\u2019s steps interactively, with the system\u2019s guidance and help, when necessary. Next, we present assessment approaches integrated in the system that aim to assist tutors in assessing the performance of students, reduce their marking task workload and provide immediate and meaningful feedback to students. Automatic assessment is achieved in four stages, which constitute a general assessment framework. First, the system calculates the similarity between the student\u2019s and the correct answer using the edit distance metric. In the next stage, it identifies the type of the answer, based on an introduced answer categorization scheme related to completeness and accuracy of an answer, taking into account student carelessness too. Afterwards, the types of errors are identified, based on an introduced error categorization scheme. Finally, answer is automatically marked via an automated marker, based on its type, the edit distance and the type of errors made. To assess the learning effectiveness of the system an extended evaluation study was conducted in real class conditions. The experiment showed very encouraging results. Furthermore, to evaluate the performance of the assessment system, we compared the assessment mechanism against expert (human) tutors. A total of 400 students\u2019 answers were assessed by three tutors and the results showed a very good agreement between the automatic assessment system and the tutors."}}, {"name": "s40593-016-0118-8.json", "data": {"article-title": "A New Perspective of Negotiation-Based Dialog to Enhance Metacognitive Skills in the Context of Open Learner Models", "author": [{"author-name": "Raja M.

This paper proposes a new perspective of learning that advances the state of the art in fully-negotiated OLMs by exploiting learner\u2019s affective & behavioral states to generate engaging natural language dialogues that train them to enhance their metacognitive skills. In order to achieve this, we have developed the NDLtutor that provides a natural language interface to learners. Our system generates context-aware dialogues automatically to enhance learner participation and reflection. This paper provides details on the design and implementation of the NDLtutor and discusses two evaluation studies. The first evaluation study focuses on the dialogue management capabilities of our system and demonstrates that our dialog system works satisfactorily to realize meaningful and natural interactions for negotiation. The second evaluation study investigates the effects of our system on the self-assessment and self-reflection of the learners. The results of the evaluations show that the NDLtutor is able to produce significant improvements in the self-assessment accuracy of the learners and also provides adequate support for prompting self-reflection in learners."}}, {"name": "s40593-016-0121-0.json", "data": {"article-title": "Designing Academic Writing Analytics for Civil Law Student Self-Assessment", "author": [{"author-name": "Simon Knight", "affiliation": "University of Technology Sydney", "address": "0000 0004 1936 7611, grid.117476.2, Connected Intelligence Centre, University of Technology Sydney, Broadway, Ultimo, 2007, NSW, Australia"}, {"author-name": "Simon Buckingham Shum", "affiliation": "University of Technology Sydney", "address": "0000 0004 1936 7611, grid.117476.2, Connected Intelligence Centre, University of Technology Sydney, Broadway, Ultimo, 2007, NSW, Australia"}, {"author-name": "Philippa Ryan", "affiliation": "University of Technology Sydney", "address": "0000 0004 1936 7611, grid.117476.2, Faculty of Law, University of Technology Sydney, Broadway, Ultimo, NSW, 2007, Australia"}, {"author-name": "\u00c1gnes S\u00e1ndor", "affiliation": "6 chemin Maupertuis", "address": "grid.426471.2, 0000 0004 1798 2960, Xerox Research Centre Europe, 6 chemin Maupertuis, F-38240, Meylan, France"}, {"author-name": "Xiaolong Wang", "affiliation": "University of Technology Sydney", "address": "0000 0004 1936 7611, grid.117476.2, Connected Intelligence Centre, University of Technology Sydney, Broadway, Ultimo, 2007, NSW, Australia"}], "journal-title": "International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education", "journal-volume": "volume28", "pageStart": "1", "pageEnd": "28", "publication-year": "2018", "keywords": ["Learning analytics", "Writing analytics", "Argumentation", "Natural language processing", "Rhetoric", "Civil law", "Participatory design"], "citation": "Knight, S., Buckingham Shum, S., Ryan, P. et al.

We discuss how our approach is positioned in relation to concerns regarding automated essay grading, and ways in which AWA might provide more actionable feedback to students. We conclude by considering how this design process addresses the challenge of making explicit to learners and educators the underlying mode of action in analytic devices such as our rhetorical parser, which we term algorithmic accountability."}}, {"name": "s40593-016-0122-z.json", "data": {"article-title": "Assessing Text-Based Writing of Low-Skilled College Students", "author": [{"author-name": "Dolores Perin", "affiliation": "Columbia University", "address": "0000000419368729, grid.21729.3f, Teachers College, Columbia University, 525 W. 120th Street, Box 70, New York, NY, 10027, USA"}, {"author-name": "Mark Lauterbach", "affiliation": "City University of New York", "address": "0000 0001 2188 3760, grid.262273.0, Brooklyn College, City University of New York, 2401 James Hall, 2900 Bedford Avenue, Brooklyn, NY, 11210, USA"}], "journal-title": "International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education", "journal-volume": "volume28", "pageStart": "56", "pageEnd": "78", "publication-year": "2018", "keywords": ["Writing skills", "Automated scoring", "Adult students", "Persuasive essay", "Written summary"], "citation": "Perin, D., Lauterbach, M.

High-level system features that emotion-aware systems can tailor to learners in order to elicit positive emotions are also described and exemplified.

However, similarly to other Exploratory Learning Environments, students may not always learn effectively in these unstructured environments. Thus, providing adaptive support has great potential to help improve student learning with these rich activities. Providing adaptive support requires a student model that can both evaluate learning as well inform relevant feedback. Building such a model for interactive simulations is especially challenging because the exploratory nature of the interaction makes it hard to know a priori which behaviors are conducive to learning. To address this problem, in this paper we leverage the student modeling framework proposed in (Kardan and Conati, 2011) to specifically address the challenge of modeling students in interactive simulations. The framework has already been successfully applied to build a student model and to give adaptive interventions for an interactive simulation for constraint satisfaction. We seek to investigate the generality of the framework by building student models for a more complex simulation on electric circuits called Circuit Construction Kit (CCK). We evaluate alternative representations of logged interaction data with CCK, capturing different amounts of granularity and feature engineering. We then apply the student modeling framework proposed in (Kardan and Conati, 2011) to group students based on their interaction behaviors, map these behaviors into learning outcomes and leverage the resulting clusters to classify new learners. Data collected from 100 college students working with the CCK simulation indicates that the proposed framework is able to successfully classify students in groups of high and low learners and identify patterns of productive behaviors that are common across representations that can inform real-time feedback. In addition to presenting these results, we discuss trade-offs between levels of granularity and feature engineering in the tested interaction representations in terms of their ability to evaluate learning, classify students, and inform feedback."}}, {"name": "s40593-016-0132-x.json", "data": {"article-title": "Automated Assessment of the Quality of Peer Reviews using Natural Language Processing Techniques", "author": [{"author-name": "Lakshmi Ramachandran", "affiliation": "Pearson", "address": "0000 0001 0308 5052, grid.420876.f, Pearson, Boulder, CO, USA"}, {"author-name": "Edward F.

By examining the accessible feedback representation, students can infer if their work with the novel representation is correct. This paper presents the criteria for grounded feedback, provides examples of systems that implement grounded feedback, contrasts grounded feedback with similar feedback types, and discusses the evidence for grounded feedback\u2019s effectiveness. Controlled experiments with random assignment that compare grounded feedback to other approaches are limited in number and scope (i.e., comparisons to explicit verification with and without text hints, linked representations, and no feedback).

Therefore, students\u2019 learning of content knowledge and of representational competencies (i.e., knowledge about representations) is invariably intertwined. Consequently, instruction may need to adapt not only to students\u2019 acquisition of content knowledge but also to their acquisition of representational competencies. This claim corresponds to the hypothesis that knowledge-component models that describe content knowledge and representational competencies should be more accurate than knowledge-component models that describe only content knowledge. Yet, this hypothesis has not yet been tested. The work in this article tests this hypothesis by comparing knowledge-component models that describe representational competencies and content knowledge to knowledgecomponent models that describe only content knowledge. Analysis of log data from two experiments on chemistry learning with overall 203 undergraduate students suggests that including representational competencies into knowledge-component models increases model fit if the representational competencies are difficult. This finding suggests that students can learn abstract content knowledge only if they have a prerequisite level of representational competencies, and that educational technologies should use adaptive knowledge-component models that capture representational competencies the student has not yet mastered."}}, {"name": "s40593-016-0135-7.json", "data": {"article-title": "New Directions in Formative Feedback in Interactive Learning Environments", "author": [{"author-name": "Ilya Goldin", "affiliation": "2U, Inc.", "address": "2U, Inc., Landover, MD, USA"}, {"author-name": "Susanne Narciss", "affiliation": "Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden", "address": "0000 0001 2111 7257, grid.4488.0, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"}, {"author-name": "Peter Foltz", "affiliation": "Pearson", "address": "0000 0001 0308 5052, grid.420876.f, Pearson, Boulder, CO, USA"}, {"author-name": "Malcolm Bauer", "affiliation": "Educational Testing Service", "address": "0000 0004 1936 9051, grid.286674.9, Educational Testing Service, Princeton, NJ, USA"}], "journal-title": "International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education", "journal-volume": "volume27", "pageStart": "385", "pageEnd": "392", "publication-year": "2017", "keywords": ["Formative feedback", "Formative assessment", "Individual differences", "Ill-defined domains", "Peer feedback"], "citation": "Goldin, I., Narciss, S., Foltz, P. et al.

Classroom assignments required students to write paper drafts and submit them to a peer-review system. When student peers later submitted feedback comments on the papers to the system, Natural Language Processing was used to automatically evaluate peer feedback quality with respect to localization (i.e., pinpointing the source of the comment in the paper being reviewed). These evaluations in turn triggered immediate formative feedback by the system, which was designed to increase peer feedback localization whenever a feedback submission was predicted to have a ratio of localized comments less than a threshold. System feedback was dynamically generated based on the results of localization prediction. Reviewers could choose to either revise their feedback comments to address the system\u2019s feedback or could ignore the feedback. Our analysis of data from system logs demonstrates that our peer feedback localization prediction model triggered the formative feedback with high precision, particularly when peer feedback comments were written by college students.

One of them, which brings difficulties to students to deal with, is converting natural language (NL) sentences into first-order logic (FOL) formulas. To assist students to overcome those difficulties, we developed the NLtoFOL system and equipped it with a strong assistance and feedback mechanism. In this work, first, we present that feedback mechanism. The mechanism can provide assistance before an answer is submitted, if requested, but mainly it provides assistance after an answer is submitted. To that end, it characterizes the answer in terms of completeness and accuracy to determine the level of incorrectness, based on an answer categorization scheme, introduced in this paper. The automatically generated natural language feedback sequences grow from general to specific and can include statements on a student\u2019s metacognitive state. Feedback is provided as natural language sentences automatically generated through a template-based natural language generation mechanism. Second, we present an extensive evaluation of the effectiveness of the assistance and feedback mechanism on students\u2019 learning. The evaluation of feedback with students showed that full feedback sequences lead to greater learning gains than sequences consisting of only flag feedback and bottom-out hints (n\u2009=\u2009226), and that generic, template-based feedback sequences are comparable to the utility of problem-specific hints generated by human tutors (n\u2009=\u2009120)."}}, {"name": "s40593-017-0141-4.json", "data": {"article-title": "Reflective Writing About the Utility Value of Science as a Tool for Increasing STEM Motivation and Retention \u2013 Can AI Help Scale Up?", "author": [{"author-name": "Beata Beigman Klebanov", "affiliation": "Educational Testing Service", "address": "0000 0004 1936 9051, grid.286674.9, Educational Testing Service, Princeton, NJ, 08541, USA"}, {"author-name": "Jill Burstein", "affiliation": "Educational Testing Service", "address": "0000 0004 1936 9051, grid.286674.9, Educational Testing Service, Princeton, NJ, 08541, USA"}, {"author-name": "Judith M.

The objective of the exhibit is to engage and motivate visiting children in the hope of sparking an interest in them about computer science and artificial intelligence, and cause them to consider pursuing future studies and/or careers in these fields. The exhibit interacts with the visitors, allowing them to participate in a simplified version of Turing\u2019s test that is brief and informal to suit the limitations of a five-minute exhibit. In this exhibit, the visitor (targeted towards middle school age children) invokes an avatar of his/her own choice, and acts to endow it with human-like qualities (voice, brain, eyesight and hearing). Then, the visitor engages the avatar in a (brief) question-and-answer session to determine whether the visitor thinks that he/she is interacting with a real human on a video conference or with an avatar. We consider this interaction to be an extension of the original Turing Test because, unlike Turing\u2019s original that used text via a teletype, this version features a graphical embodiment of an agent with which one can converse in spoken natural language. This extension serves to make passing the Turing Test more difficult, as now the avatar must not only communicate like a human, but also look, sound and act the part. It also makes the exhibit visual, dynamic and interesting to the visitors. Evaluations were performed with museum visitors, both in backrooms with prototypes as well as on the museum floor with the final version. The formative and summative evaluations performed indicated overall success in engaging the museum visitors and increasing their interest in computer science. More specifically, the formative testing, mostly done in quiet back rooms with selected test subjects, indicated that on the important questions about enjoyment of exhibit and increased interest in computer science by the test subjects, their self-reported Likert scale responses (1 being negative and 5 being positive) increased from 3.16 in the first evaluation to 4.38 in the third one for increased interest in CS. Likewise for the question about exhibit enjoyment (from 3.92 to 4.56). The summative evaluation, done through unobtrusive observation of exhibit use on museum floor, indicated that almost 74% of the parties that initiated the exhibit were either highly or moderately engaged by the exhibit. However, there was one major negative finding, namely the overly long duration of the exhibit, which may have caused premature abandonment of the exhibit in several cases during the summative evaluation. These tests and their results are presented and discussed in detail in this paper. The exhibit has been on permanent display at the Orlando (FL) Science Center since June 2014 and has received a strongly positive response from visitors since that time."}}, {"name": "s40593-017-0146-z.json", "data": {"article-title": "Designing Adaptive Instruction for Teams: a Meta-Analysis", "author": [{"author-name": "Robert A.

This article examines the relationship of team behaviors as antecedents to successful team performance and learning during adaptive instruction guided by Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs). Adaptive instruction is a training or educational experience tailored by artificially-intelligent, computer-based tutors with the goal of optimizing learner outcomes (e.g., knowledge and skill acquisition, performance, enhanced retention, accelerated learning, or transfer of skills from instructional environments to work environments). The core contribution of this research was the identification of behavioral markers associated with the antecedents of team performance and learning thus enabling the development and refinement of teamwork models in ITS architectures. Teamwork focuses on the coordination, cooperation, and communication among individuals to achieve a shared goal. For ITSs to optimally tailor team instruction, tutors must have key insights about both the team and the learners on that team. To aid the modeling of teams, we examined the literature to evaluate the relationship of teamwork behaviors (e.g., communication, cooperation, coordination, cognition, leadership/coaching, and conflict) with team outcomes (learning, performance, satisfaction, and viability) as part of a large-scale meta-analysis of the ITS, team training, and team performance literature. While ITSs have been used infrequently to instruct teams, the goal of this meta-analysis make team tutoring more ubiquitous by: identifying significant relationships between team behaviors and effective performance and learning outcomes; developing instructional guidelines for team tutoring based on these relationships; and applying these team tutoring guidelines to the Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT), an open source architecture for authoring, delivering, managing, and evaluating adaptive instructional tools and methods.

Intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) have been used successfully to teach individuals, but so far only a few ITSs have been used for the purpose of training teams. This is due to the difficulty of creating such systems. An ITS for teams must be able to assess complex interactions between team members (team skills) as well as the way they interact with the system itself (task skills). Assessing team skills can be difficult because they contain social components such as communication and coordination that are not readily quantifiable. This article addresses these difficulties by developing a framework to guide the authoring process for team tutors. The framework is demonstrated using a case study about a particular team tutor that was developed using a military surveillance scenario for teams of two. The Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT) software provided the team tutoring infrastructure for this task. A new software architecture required to support the team tutor is described. This theoretical framework and the lessons learned from its implementation offer conceptual scaffolding for future authors of ITSs."}}, {"name": "s40593-017-0152-1.json", "data": {"article-title": "Detecting and Addressing Frustration in a Serious Game for Military Training", "author": [{"author-name": "Jeanine A.

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive report on a multi-part study that integrates detection, validation, and intervention into a unified approach. This paper examines the creation of both sensor-based and interaction-based detectors of student affect, producing successful detectors of student affect. In addition, it reports results from an investigation of motivational feedback messages designed to address student frustration, and investigates whether linking these interventions to detectors improves outcomes. Our results are mixed, finding that self-efficacy enhancing interventions based on interaction-based affect detectors enhance outcomes in one of two experiments investigating affective interventions.

However, ITS community still lacks a current understanding of how authoring tools are used by non-programmer authors to design ITS. Hence, the objective of this work is to review how authoring tools have been supporting ITS design for non-programmer authors. In order to meet our goal, we conduct a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to identify the primary studies on the use of ITS authoring tools, following a pre-defined review protocol. Among the 4622 papers retrieved from seven digital libraries published from 2009 to June 2016, 33 papers are finally included after applying our exclusion and inclusion criteria. We then identify the main ITS components authored, the ITS types designed, the features used to facilitate the authoring process, the technologies used to develop authoring tools and the time at which authoring occurs. We also look for evidence of the benefits of ITS authoring tools. In summary, the main findings of this work are: (1) there is empirical evidence of the benefits (i.e., mainly in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, quality of authored artifacts, and usability) of using ITS authoring tools for non-programmer authors, specially to aid authoring of learning content and to support authoring of model-tracing/cognitive and example-tracing tutors; 2) domain and pedagogical models have been much more targeted by authoring tools; (3) several ITS types have been authored, with an emphasis on model-tracing/cognitive and example-tracing tutors; (4) besides providing features for authoring all four ITS components, current authoring tools are also presenting general features (e.g., view learners\u2019 statistics and reuse tutor design) to create broader authoring tools; (5) a great diversity of technologies, which include AI techniques, software solutions and distributed technologies, are used to develop ITS authoring tools; and (6) authoring tools have been mainly targeting ITS design before students\u2019 instruction, but works are also addressing authoring during and/or post-instruction relying both on human and artificial intelligence.

Through interviews with 12 ELL online students, and a survey with 20,084 ELL respondents, we investigate ELL students\u2019 motivations for taking online courses. We show that ELL students\u2019 motivations are highly socialized strategies for achieving long-term goals of economic, social, and geographic mobility. Although research studies show that ELLs interact sparingly with other students in MOOCs, we present evidence that they have unmet needs for interaction, and discuss how student interaction systems in MOOCs can better address these needs. Finally, we show evidence that ELLs deliberately use English MOOCs to improve their language skills, even when the content is not language-related.

We use video, audio, gesture and bio-physiology data from a two-condition study (N\u00a0=\u00a020), to identify correlations between the multimodal data, experimental condition, and two learning outcomes: design quality and learning. The three approaches incorporate: 1) human-annotated coding of video data, 2) automated coding of gesture, audio and bio-physiological data and, 3) concatenated human-annotated and automatically annotated data. Within each analysis we employ the same machine learning and sequence mining techniques. Ultimately we find that each approach provides different affordances depending on the similarity metric and the dependent variable. For example, the analysis based on human-annotated data found strong correlations among multimodal behaviors, experimental condition, success and learning, when we relaxed constraints on temporal similarity. The second approach performed well when comparing students\u2019 multimodal behaviors as a time series, but was less effective using the temporally relaxed similarity metric. The take-away is that there are several strategies for doing multimodal learning analytics, and that many of these approaches can provide a meaningful glimpse into a complex data set, glimpses that may be difficult to identify using traditional approaches."}}, {"name": "s40593-017-0161-0.json", "data": {"article-title": "The Civic Mission of MOOCs: Engagement across Political Differences in Online Forums", "author": [{"author-name": "Michael Yeomans", "affiliation": "Harvard University", "address": "000000041936754X, grid.38142.3c, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"}, {"author-name": "Brandon M.

While most US-based tools, particularly those also used in secondary education, are targeting on the essay genre, TW is tailored to the needs of theses and research article writing (IMRD scheme). This mixed-methods paper reports data of a test run with a first-year course of 102 business administration students. A technology adoption model served as a frame of reference for the research design. From a student\u2019s perspective, problems posed by the task of writing a research proposal as well as the use, usability, and usefulness of TW were studied through an online survey and focus groups (explanatory sequential design).

An abundance of structured and semi-structured data has led to the development of automatic MCQ generation methods. Recently, ontologies have emerged as powerful tools to enable the automatic generation of MCQs. However, current question generation approaches focus on knowledge recall questions. In addition, questions that have so far been generated are, compared to manually created ones, simple and cover only a small subset of the required question complexity space in the education and assessment domain. In this paper, we focus on addressing the limitations of previous approaches by generating questions with complex stems that are suitable for scenarios beyond mere knowledge recall. We present a novel ontology-based approach that exploits classes and existential restrictions to generate case-based questions. Our contribution lies in: (1) the specification of procedure for generating case-based questions which involve (a) assembling complex stems, (b) selecting suitable options, and (c) providing explanations for option correctness/incorrectness, (2) an implementation of the procedure using a medical ontology and (3) and evaluation of our generation technique to test question quality and their suitability in practise. We implement our approach as an application for a medical education scenario on top of a large knowledge base in the medical domain. We generate more than 3 million questions for four physician specialities and evaluate our approach in a user study with 15 medical experts. We find that using a stratified random sample of 435 questions out of which 316 were rated by two experts, 129 (30%) are considered appropriate to be used in exams by both experts and a further 216 (50%) by at least one expert."}}, {"name": "s40593-018-00173-9.json", "data": {"article-title": "Inferring Students\u2019 Personality from Their Communication Behavior in Web-based Learning Systems", "author": [{"author-name": "Wen Wu", "affiliation": "Hong Kong Baptist University", "address": "0000 0004 1764 5980, grid.221309.b, Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong, China"}, {"author-name": "Li Chen", "affiliation": "Hong Kong Baptist University", "address": "0000 0004 1764 5980, grid.221309.b, Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong, China"}, {"author-name": "Qingchang Yang", "affiliation": "Hong Kong Baptist University", "address": "0000 0004 1764 5980, grid.221309.b, Adaptive Learning Center, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong, China"}, {"author-name": "You Li", "affiliation": "Jiachen Technology Limited", "address": "Jiachen Technology Limited, Hong Kong, China"}], "journal-title": "International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education", "journal-volume": "volume29", "pageStart": "189", "pageEnd": "216", "publication-year": "2019", "keywords": ["Web-based learning system", "Personality prediction", "Synchornous/asynchronous communication", "User survey", "Linguistic content"], "citation": "Wu, W., Chen, L., Yang, Q. et al.

It is critical that medical first responders are well trained to deal with emergencies more effectively. This would require real-time monitoring and feedback for each trainee. Therefore, we introduced a voice-based SA to augment the training process of medical first responders and enhance their performance in the field. The potential benefits of SAs include a reduction in training costs and enhanced monitoring mechanisms. Despite the increased usage of voice-based personal assistants (PAs) in day-to-day life, the associated effects are commonly neglected for a study of human factors. Therefore, this paper focuses on performance analysis of the developed voice-based SA in emergency care provider training for a selected emergency treatment scenario. The research discussed in this paper follows design science in developing proposed technology; at length, we discussed architecture and development and presented working results of voice-based SA. The empirical testing was conducted on two groups as user studies using statistical analysis tools, one trained with conventional methods and the other with the help of SA. The statistical results demonstrated the amplification in training efficacy and performance of medical responders powered by SA.

By means of data logging and questionnaires, the study compared the effects of high vs. low agent self-efficacy on the students\u2019 in-game performance, their own math self-efficacy, and their attitude towards their agent. The study further explored the effects of matching vs. mismatching between student and agent with respect to self-efficacy. Overall, students who interacted with an agent with low self-efficacy performed better than students interacting with an agent with high self-efficacy. This was especially apparent for students who had reported low self-efficacy themselves, who performed on par with students with high self-efficacy when interacting with a digital tutee with low self-efficacy. Furthermore, students with low self-efficacy significantly increased their self-efficacy in the matched condition, i.e. when instructing a teachable agent with low self-efficacy. They also increased their self-efficacy when instructing a teachable agent with high self-efficacy, but to a smaller extent and not significantly. For students with high self-efficacy, a potential corresponding effect on a self-efficacy change due to matching may be hidden behind a ceiling effect. As a preliminary conclusion, on the basis of the results of this study, we propose that teachable agents should preferably be designed to have low self-efficacy."}}, {"name": "s40593-018-0168-1.json", "data": {"article-title": "Personalizing Algebra to Students\u2019 Individual Interests in an Intelligent Tutoring System: Moderators of Impact", "author": [{"author-name": "Candace Walkington", "affiliation": "Southern Methodist University", "address": "0000 0004 1936 7929, grid.263864.d, Southern Methodist University, 3101 University Blvd., Ste. 345, Dallas, TX, 75025, USA"}, {"author-name": "Matthew L.

However, benefits may only be realized when students\u2019 degree of quantitative engagement with their out-of-school interests matches the depth at which the personalized problems are written. Students whose quantitative engagement with their interests is minimal may benefit most when problems draw upon superficial aspects of their interest areas. Students who report significant quantitative engagement with their interests may benefit most when individual interests are deeply incorporated into the quantitative structure of math problems.

To help overcome the lack of suitable environments for increasing L2 learners\u2019 WTC, our approach is to build embodied conversational agents that can help learners surmount their apprehension towards communication in L2. Here, we focus on the dialogue management aspects of our approach and propose a model based on a set of communication strategies (CS) and affective backchannels (AB) to foster such agents\u2019 ability to carry on natural and WTC-friendly conversations with learners. We examined learners\u2019 expected WTC after interacting with one of the following versions of the system: an agent featuring both CS and AB; an agent featuring only CS; and an agent featuring only AB. The results suggested that combining CS and AB empowers the conversational agent and leads to higher expected WTC among L2 learners. We also found that even the AB-only version of the system had the potential to enhance WTC to some extent.

We then combine the features corresponding to the DKT/DKT+ expected knowledge state with other features extracted directly from the student profile in the dataset to train several machine learning models for the STEM/non-STEM job prediction. Our experiments show that models trained with the combined features generally perform better than the models trained with the student profile alone.

In an experimental study, 199 middle schoolers worked with either motivational, task\u2009+\u2009motivational, or problematizing\u2009+\u2009task\u2009+\u2009motivational guidance versions of the Coach while inventing. Students who engaged with the problematizing Coach were better able to transfer their knowledge to novel domains in the short term, and their transfer gains were comparable to those provoked by human tutors. While students in the problematizing condition were less likely to invent the correct solutions, they engaged in more targeted and efficient exploration of the solution space and were less likely to report experiences of difficulty. Findings suggest that problematizing guidance has the potential to effectively support exploratory problem-solving, when the goal is to facilitate productive exploration and transfer from subsequent instruction. The work also has implications for the design of problematizing guidance."}}, {"name": "s40593-019-00179-x.json", "data": {"article-title": "Investigating the Effect of Agency on Learning from Worked Examples, Erroneous Examples and Problem Solving", "author": [{"author-name": "Xingliang Chen", "affiliation": "University of Canterbury", "address": "0000 0001 2179 1970, grid.21006.35, Intelligent Computer Tutoring Group, Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand"}, {"author-name": "Antonija Mitrovic", "affiliation": "University of Canterbury", "address": "0000 0001 2179 1970, grid.21006.35, Intelligent Computer Tutoring Group, Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand"}, {"author-name": "Moffat Mathews", "affiliation": "University of Canterbury", "address": "0000 0001 2179 1970, grid.21006.35, Intelligent Computer Tutoring Group, Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand"}], "journal-title": "International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education", "journal-volume": "volume29", "pageStart": "396", "pageEnd": "424", "publication-year": "2019", "keywords": ["Problem solving", "Worked examples", "Erroneous examples", "Adaptive selection of learning activities", "Agency", "Intelligent tutoring systems"], "citation": "Chen, X., Mitrovic, A. & Mathews, M.

Most studies on agency in computer-based learning environments have been conducted in the context of educational games and multimedia learning, while there is little research done in the context of learning with Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs). We conducted a study in the context of SQL-Tutor, an ITS that teaches database querying, with students solving a fixed set of ten problems. Before each problem, students worked on a preparatory task, which could be presented as a worked example, erroneous example, or another isomorphic problem. There were two conditions in the study. In the High-Agency condition, students could select the type of preparatory task freely or skip it altogether. In the Low-Agency condition, an adaptive strategy selected preparatory tasks for students on the basis of their performance. The participants were classified as High Prior Knowledge (HPK) or Low Prior Knowledge (LPK), based on their scores on the pre-test. Due to the timing of the study, we had 40 participants who completed all elements of the study. The participants in both Low- and High-Agency conditions improved significantly from the pre- to post-test, and there was no difference between the LPK and HPK students on post-test scores. Therefore, we have not found an effect of agency on learning. The Low Agency condition was beneficial for both HPK and LPK students, while in the High Agency condition there was significant improvement between the pre- and post-test only for the LPK students. In the High-Agency group, the HPK students selected more challenging learning activities, but did not outperform LPK students on the post-test scores.

Iterative development cycles become very rapid, limited by the time required to analyze data and deploy system updates. D3 is particularly relevant to fielded AIED systems that operate in uncontrolled conditions, where learners may behave in unexpected ways.

A new version was released and data were collected from a second snapshot evaluation at the University of Split, Croatia. Data from learners in Latin America and Europe were analyzed for comparison. The evaluations provided preliminary evidence that Enskill English is helpful for learning spoken English skills, and leading indicators that learner performance improves through practice with Enskill English.

This paper provides evidence that learning analytics in MOOCs can be significantly biased by users who abuse the anonymity and open-nature of MOOCs, for example by setting up multiple accounts, due to their amount and aberrant behavior. We identify these users, denoted fake learners, using dedicated algorithms. The methodology for measuring the bias caused by fake learners\u2019 activity combines the ideas of Replication Research and Sensitivity Analysis. We replicate two highly-cited learning analytics studies with and without fake learners data, and compare the results.

Many researchers have realized that reinforcement learning provides a natural framework for optimal instructional sequencing given a particular model of student learning, and excitement towards this area of research is as alive now as it was over fifty years ago. But does RL actually help students learn? If so, when and where might we expect it to be most helpful? To help answer these questions, we review the variety of attempts to use RL for instructional sequencing. First, we present a historical narrative of this research area. We identify three waves of research, which gives us a sense of the various communities of researchers that have been interested in this problem and where the field is going. Second, we review all of the empirical research that has compared RL-induced instructional policies to baseline methods of sequencing. We find that over half of the studies found that RL-induced policies significantly outperform baselines. Moreover, we identify five clusters of studies with different characteristics and varying levels of success in using RL to help students learn. We find that reinforcement learning has been most successful in cases where it has been constrained with ideas and theories from cognitive psychology and the learning sciences. However, given that our theories and models are limited, we also find that it has been useful to complement this approach with running more robust offline analyses that do not rely heavily on the assumptions of one particular model. Given that many researchers are turning to deep reinforcement learning and big data to tackle instructional sequencing, we believe keeping these best practices in mind can help guide the way to the reward in using RL for instructional sequencing."}}, {"name": "s40593-019-00188-w.json", "data": {"article-title": "Impact of an Artificial Intelligence Research Frame on the Perceived Credibility of Educational Research Evidence", "author": [{"author-name": "Mutlu Cukurova", "affiliation": "University College London", "address": "grid.83440.3b, 0000000121901201, UCL Knowledge Lab, University College London, 23- 29 Emerald Street, London, WC1N 3QS, UK"}, {"author-name": "Rosemary Luckin", "affiliation": "University College London", "address": "grid.83440.3b, 0000000121901201, UCL Knowledge Lab, University College London, 23- 29 Emerald Street, London, WC1N 3QS, UK"}, {"author-name": "Carmel Kent", "affiliation": "University College London", "address": "grid.83440.3b, 0000000121901201, UCL Knowledge Lab, University College London, 23- 29 Emerald Street, London, WC1N 3QS, UK"}], "journal-title": "International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education", "journal-volume": "volume30", "pageStart": "205", "pageEnd": "235", "publication-year": "2020", "keywords": ["AI in Education", "Perceived credibility", "Research evidence", "The in-credible AI effect"], "citation": "Cukurova, M., Luckin, R. & Kent, C.

In the literature, there is evidence that people overweight research evidence when framed in neuroscience findings. In this paper, we present the findings of the first investigation of the impact of an AI frame on the perceived credibility of educational research evidence. In an experimental study, we allocated 605 participants including educators\u00a0to one of three conditions in which the same educational research evidence was framed within one of: AI, neuroscience, or educational psychology. The results demonstrate that when educational research evidence is framed within AI research, it is considered as less credible in comparison to when it is framed instead within neuroscience or educational psychology. The effect is still evident when the subjects\u2019 familiarity with the framing discipline is controlled for. Furthermore, our results indicate that the general public perceives AI to be: less helpful in assisting us to understand how children learn, lacking in adherence to scientific methods, and to be less prestigious compared to neuroscience and educational psychology. Considering the increased use of AI technologies in Educational settings, we argue that there should be significant attempts to recover the public image of AI being less scientifically robust and less prestigious than educational psychology and neuroscience. We conclude the article suggesting that AI in Education community should attempt to be more actively engaged with key stakeholders of AI and Education to help mitigate such effects."}}, {"name": "s40593-019-00189-9.json", "data": {"article-title": "Time- and Learner-Dependent Hidden Markov Model for Writing Process Analysis Using Keystroke Log Data", "author": [{"author-name": "Masaki Uto", "affiliation": "The University of Electro-Communications", "address": "grid.266298.1, 0000 0000 9271 9936, The University of Electro-Communications, 1-5-1 Chofugaoka, Chofu, Tokyo, 182-8585, Japan"}, {"author-name": "Yoshimitsu Miyazawa", "affiliation": "The National Center for University Entrance Examinations", "address": "grid.460033.2, 0000 0004 0620 4696, The National Center for University Entrance Examinations, 2-19-23 Komaba, Meguro, Tokyo, 153-8501, Japan"}, {"author-name": "Yoshihiro Kato", "affiliation": "Benesse Educational Research and Development Institute", "address": "grid.471540.3, Benesse Educational Research and Development Institute, 1-34 Ochiai, Tama, Tokyo, 206-8686, Japan"}, {"author-name": "Koji Nakajima", "affiliation": "Benesse Educational Research and Development Institute", "address": "grid.471540.3, Benesse Educational Research and Development Institute, 1-34 Ochiai, Tama, Tokyo, 206-8686, Japan"}, {"author-name": "Hajime Kuwata", "affiliation": "Benesse Educational Research and Development Institute", "address": "grid.471540.3, Benesse Educational Research and Development Institute, 1-34 Ochiai, Tama, Tokyo, 206-8686, Japan"}], "journal-title": "International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education", "journal-volume": "volume30", "pageStart": "271", "pageEnd": "298", "publication-year": "2020", "keywords": ["Writing skills", "Writing process", "Keystroke log", "Hidden Markov model", "Markov chain Monte Carlo method"], "citation": "Uto, M., Miyazawa, Y., Kato, Y. et al.

Therefore, instructor feedback is often given based on sequence patterns of those subtasks. For such feedback, instructors need to analyze sequence patterns for all learners, which becomes problematic as the number of learners increases. To resolve this problem, this study proposes a new machine-learning method that estimates sequence patterns from keystroke log data. Specifically, we propose an extension of the Gaussian hidden Markov model that incorporates parameters representing temporal change in a subtask appearance distribution for each learner. Furthermore, we propose a collapsed Gibbs sampling algorithm as the parameter estimation method for the proposed model.

An important methodological goal was to go beyond observable behavior and shed some light on how cognitive processing and understanding in children of such young age can be studied.

Second, in an experimental part of the study, the children\u2019s gaze behaviors were measured during 5 rounds of interaction with an experimental version of one of the sub-games. The analyses suggest that two of the gaze behaviors were positively correlated with the game performance measure, as hypothesized. Another result was that children looked at the teachable agent significantly more often when the teachable agent had been in charge of gameplay than when it had not. This can be interpreted as an indication that the children had an understanding of their teachable agent as an entity that, like themselves and unlike other dynamic visual elements in the game, made decisions based on own \u2018knowledge\u2019.

We use this system in a randomized controlled trial that investigates whether active learning is best when it is implemented as guided deliberate practice, as constructive \u201chands-on\u201d activity, or as a combination of both. Automated, reactive guidance is made possible by a specialized AI computer vision algorithm we developed to track what children are doing in the physical environment as they do experiments and discoveries with physical objects. The results support deliberate practice and indicate that having some guided discovery based on effective learning mechanism such as self-explanation, contrasting cases and personalized interactive feedback produces more robust learning compared to exploratory construction alone. Children learning through guided discovery achieve greater understanding of the scientific principles than children learning through hands-on construction alone (4 times more pre-to-post test improvement). Importantly, a combined guided discovery and hands-on construction condition leads to better learning of the very hands-on construction skills that are the sole focus of the hands-on constructive learning condition (>10 times more pre-to-post improvement).

The proposed computer vision-based behavior monitoring method uses a low-cost webcam and can easily be integrated with modern tutoring technologies. We investigate these behaviors in-depth over time in a classroom session of 40 minutes involving reading and problem-solving exercises. The exercises in the sessions are divided into three categories: an easy, medium and difficult topic within the context of undergraduate computer science. We found that there is a significant increase in head and eye movements as time progresses, as well as with the increase of difficulty level. We demonstrated that there is a considerable occurrence of hand-over-face gestures (on average 21.35%) during the 40 minutes session and is unexplored in the education domain. We propose a novel deep learning approach for automatic detection of hand-over-face gestures in images with a classification accuracy of 86.87%. There is a prominent increase in hand-over-face gestures when the difficulty level of the given exercise increases. The hand-over-face gestures occur more frequently during problem-solving (easy 23.79%, medium 19.84% and difficult 30.46%) exercises in comparison to reading (easy 16.20%, medium 20.06% and difficult 20.18%)."}}, {"name": "s40593-020-00197-0.json", "data": {"article-title": "Improving Engagement in Program Construction Examples for Learning Python Programming", "author": [{"author-name": "Roya Hosseini", "affiliation": "University of Pittsburgh", "address": "grid.21925.3d, 0000 0004 1936 9000, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"}, {"author-name": "Kamil Akhuseyinoglu", "affiliation": "University of Pittsburgh", "address": "grid.21925.3d, 0000 0004 1936 9000, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"}, {"author-name": "Peter Brusilovsky", "affiliation": "University of Pittsburgh", "address": "grid.21925.3d, 0000 0004 1936 9000, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"}, {"author-name": "Lauri Malmi", "affiliation": "Aalto University", "address": "grid.5373.2, 0000000108389418, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland"}, {"author-name": "Kerttu Pollari-Malmi", "affiliation": "Aalto University", "address": "grid.5373.2, 0000000108389418, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland"}, {"author-name": "Christian Schunn", "affiliation": "University of Pittsburgh", "address": "grid.21925.3d, 0000 0004 1936 9000, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"}, {"author-name": "Teemu Sirki\u00e4", "affiliation": "Aalto University", "address": "grid.5373.2, 0000000108389418, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland"}], "journal-title": "International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education", "journal-volume": "volume30", "pageStart": "299", "pageEnd": "336", "publication-year": "2020", "keywords": ["Introductory programming education", "CS1", "Python", "Program construction", "Worked examples", "Classroom study"], "citation": "Hosseini, R., Akhuseyinoglu, K., Brusilovsky, P. et al.
